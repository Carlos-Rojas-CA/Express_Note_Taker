# Express_Note_Taker

## Purpose
A person needing to save their note online to have access anywhere. They would be able to go to the website and view old notes and be able to creat new notes. Once they are done with note, they may delete it if they want. Can easily become a checklist as well.

### Committ: 
1st: Overall working on a localhost:8000. Does not edit the db.json file. Might need to do a FS write and read.
